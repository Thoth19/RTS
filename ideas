game idea
troops
melee, ranged, cavalry
with levels: 
human, mythic, heroic, god
human
melee has 1 damage and 2 hp
ranged has 1 damage and 1 hp
cavalry has 2 damage and 1 hp (+1 damage turn one)

mythic
double, but 3x the cost

heroic,
same power as mythic
bonus damage against mythic
4x cost

God
10x stat, 15x cost

Battlefield
(not displayed?)
two tiles separate first lines,
and go in order of melee, ranged

cavalry inflict damage to archers. if none, melee, if none cav
melee inflict damage to melee, cav, archers, move
ranged inflcit damage to cav, melee, archers (possibly make them weak against cav)

battlefield size is min 50, army size


War is costly:
If you win:
you get 1/2 the value of all dead units
If you lose:
you get 1/4 the value of your dead units

Some sort of farming mechanism?
farms => food => human +
temples => favor => mythic +
mines => gold => heroic +
altar => sacerific =>gods (kill villagers for god summon)
farm/temple/mine can support workers apiece, task workers to generate resources per turn
all resource buildings require food except altar which requires all three
can build human, mythic, heroic, god workers which are 1x,2x,3x,5x

defending a castle, theres a wall that serves as an extra melee unit with priority
